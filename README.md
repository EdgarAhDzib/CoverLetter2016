To the Hiring Manager:

I am writing in response to your announcement for the position of Web Developer. I have been writing in HTML since 1996, and I have extensive experience with combining JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and CSS in my web designs. The coding boot-camp course I am completing from the University of Texas has been training me in both the foundational principles and current platforms for full-stack development. I can bring a complement of backgrounds in coding and presentation to the quality of my work at your company.

Since 2014 I have been the freelance webmaster for the Crow Haven Corner shop in Salem, Massachusetts. Although I am not the original author for the online store, I have restructured it to improve navigability. I consolidated the shopping links to a new “Shop” page, minimizing the website’s architecture. For the gold and silver jewelry page, I converted a wholesale vendor’s Excel spreadsheets into CSV files and then transformed them into two SQL database tables. To display their image, description, and price content on the page, I then wrote a PHP script to join the tables and print those items with available eBay button codes.

In 2015 I wrote an e-commerce web store for Feathered Serpent Imports. This work illustrates how I integrate JavaScript, PHP, SQL, CSS, and HTML into an effective product, such as listing the shop’s available products through a PHP loop and expanding Lightbox photo galleries from single thumbnails. I wrote prepared SQL statements for each catalog page to prevent SQL injection or other tampering. I also wrote API scripts to calculate domestic, Canadian, and European shipping rates from USPS. The website incorporates a shopping cart and PayPal checkout that reflect my skills across several web and server interfaces, as well as my ability to create and edit databases and other files.

The full-stack curriculum I am completing enables me to implement web projects from the server architecture to the front-end display. With experience in Node / Express server programming and facility with the Sequelize and Handlebars platforms, I am able to work across the Model-View-Controller paradigm, as I did to write apps for a mock hamburger menu and the foundation for an open encyclopedia of Native American cultures. These skills have expanded on my expertise with SQL databases, which I have been implementing since 2015. They have also strengthened my ease with learning new programming languages and systems for back-end development.

I have been working with Adobe software since 2003, and my knowledge of Photoshop Elements has been invaluable for the graphics I have been applying to my web publications, such as wallpaper images and floating logos I have prepared specifically for my active sites. My web design draws from my ability to create and organize graphics that follow front-end logic. In this regard I am eager to work further with the React and Unity platforms, given my facility with the JavaScript language that powers both.

Although my professional coding work is relatively recent, many of my professional skills come from eight years of undergraduate teaching. My peer-reviewed publications demonstrate my capacity for research, which earned me a Fulbright-García Robles grant to complete my dissertation on indigenous folklore in Mexico. I also include my knowledge of intercultural communication and applied anthropology toward my ability to design applications for foreign audiences with diverse cultural experiences.

As a former professor I have learnt to speak publicly with conciseness and confidence. My experience with lecturing gives me the tools to clearly explain how a program works and its role within its app environment. I would therefore be ideal to teach new employees or teammates how to use particular languages or platforms. Teaching online summer courses has also given me experience with Panopto, so that I can interact with PowerPoint materials as I speak. Teleconferencing and teaching are thus critical assets I can bring to my career at your company.

Please expect a copy of my résumé with this application. Web design samples are available on my portfolio page: edgarmartindelcampo.com. I am requesting an entry-level annual salary of $70,000.

Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

Edgar Martin del Campo
